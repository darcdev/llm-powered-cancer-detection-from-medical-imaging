{"id":"4","assumption":"Cancer detection requires massive labeled datasets specific to each cancer type and imaging modality","hypothesis":"Pre-trained LLMs with vision capabilities can achieve comparable diagnostic performance with significantly less domain-specific training data by leveraging their general medical knowledge and transfer learning abilities","impact":"Could democratize access to AI-powered cancer detection in resource-limited settings and for rare cancers","timestamp":"2025-10-09T19:30:00.000Z","status":"proposed"}
{"id":"5","assumption":"Each medical image is analyzed independently without considering temporal progression or treatment response over time","hypothesis":"LLMs' natural language processing capabilities enable superior temporal reasoning about disease progression, treatment response, and longitudinal changes that traditional CNN approaches cannot capture","impact":"Could transform cancer monitoring from snapshot assessments to comprehensive temporal understanding","timestamp":"2025-10-09T19:30:00.000Z","status":"proposed"}
