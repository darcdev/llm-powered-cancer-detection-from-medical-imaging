## Core Research Questions

What are the fundamental limitations in current cancer detection approaches from medical imaging that could be addressed through Large Language Model integration?

## Research Philosophy & Approach

This research follows a hypothesis-driven methodology aimed at identifying and challenging core assumptions in cancer detection systems. Rather than incremental improvements, we seek to discover fundamental knowledge gaps that could unlock new diagnostic capabilities.

## Literature-Level Hypotheses

### 1. Multimodal Integration Hypothesis

**Prior Research Assumption**: Traditional computer vision approaches for cancer detection operate in isolation from clinical context, patient history, and radiological reports.

**Our Hypothesis**: Large Language Models with vision capabilities can fundamentally improve cancer detection by integrating multimodal information (images, clinical notes, patient history, genomic data) in ways that mirror expert radiologist reasoning patterns.

**Impact Potential**: This could reshape how we approach medical imaging AI - moving from pure pattern recognition to contextual diagnostic reasoning.

### 2. Interpretability Gap Hypothesis

**Prior Research Assumption**: Black-box deep learning models are acceptable for cancer detection as long as they achieve high accuracy metrics.

**Our Hypothesis**: The interpretability crisis in medical AI fundamentally limits clinical adoption. LLMs can provide natural language explanations for diagnostic decisions that are both technically accurate and clinically meaningful.

**Impact Potential**: Could bridge the gap between AI capability and clinical trust, enabling broader deployment of AI diagnostic tools.

### 3. Data Efficiency Hypothesis

**Prior Research Assumption**: Cancer detection requires massive labeled datasets specific to each cancer type and imaging modality.

**Our Hypothesis**: Pre-trained LLMs with vision capabilities can achieve comparable diagnostic performance with significantly less domain-specific training data by leveraging their general medical knowledge and transfer learning abilities.

**Impact Potential**: Could democratize access to AI-powered cancer detection in resource-limited settings and for rare cancers.

### 4. Temporal Reasoning Hypothesis

**Prior Research Assumption**: Each medical image is analyzed independently without considering temporal progression or treatment response over time.

**Our Hypothesis**: LLMs' natural language processing capabilities enable superior temporal reasoning about disease progression, treatment response, and longitudinal changes that traditional CNN approaches cannot capture.

**Impact Potential**: Could transform cancer monitoring from snapshot assessments to comprehensive temporal understanding.

## Research Vectors & Risk Assessment

### Biggest Dimensional Risk

The assumption that LLMs can reliably process and reason about medical imagery at the level required for clinical decision-making. If this fundamental capability is insufficient, the entire research direction becomes invalid.

### Key Validation Requirements

1. **Clinical Accuracy**: Must meet or exceed current diagnostic standards
2. **Interpretability**: Explanations must be clinically meaningful and verifiable
3. **Robustness**: Performance must be consistent across diverse patient populations and imaging conditions
4. **Safety**: False negative rates must be minimized given life-or-death consequences

## Experimental Framework

Each hypothesis will be tested through controlled experiments that:

* Compare against current state-of-the-art approaches
* Include clinical validation with expert radiologists
* Measure both quantitative performance and qualitative interpretability
* Assess generalizability across different cancer types and imaging modalities

## Expected Contributions

1. **Methodological**: New approaches for integrating LLMs with medical imaging
2. **Empirical**: Performance benchmarks on cancer detection tasks
3. **Clinical**: Interpretable AI systems that can gain clinical acceptance
4. **Theoretical**: Understanding of how language models process visual medical information
