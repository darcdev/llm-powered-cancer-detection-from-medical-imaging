# Research Concept & Direction



# theorem-proving: Discovering New Theorems Automatically



## Motivation

Discover new theorems, given a research area, with informal and formal proofs. The discovery should have characteristics that are relevant to the real world. Currently, it is evaluated on two dimensions:

- Importance

- Novelty



But this can be easily expanded.



In this version of the project, we are not going to use SFT to the LLMs. All the training is via prompts.



## User Input Example



### Research Area

In statistics, the study of the rate of convergence in nonparametric regression.



### Hyperparameters



#### Query Syntax

(A and B are theorem names, with contents in class=MyTheoremCls)
