# Research Concept & Direction

## Problem Definition

Current multimodal large language models (MLLMs) for cancer detection from medical imaging face critical limitations that hinder clinical adoption: lack of interpretable reasoning, suboptimal multimodal fusion strategies, and poor generalization across patient populations and imaging modalities. While recent advances show promise (Tordjman et al., 2025; Chen et al., 2025), fundamental assumptions about how vision-language models should process medical imaging data remain untested.

## Core Research Hypothesis

**Primary Assumption Being Challenged**: Current MLLMs treat medical image analysis as a monolithic vision-to-text generation task, following the paradigm established in natural images.

**Central Hypothesis**: Region-aware multimodal reasoning—where language models explicitly ground their diagnostic reasoning in specific anatomical regions—will significantly outperform current end-to-end approaches in cancer detection accuracy, interpretability, and clinical trustworthiness.

## Literature-Level Insights

### 1. Implicit Assumption Across Literature
Most MLLM research assumes that general vision-language architectures (e.g., CLIP-based encoders) can effectively capture medically relevant visual features through fine-tuning alone. This assumption spans from foundational work to recent applications (Wang et al., 2024; Nam et al., 2025).

### 2. Novel Research Direction
We propose that medical imaging requires fundamentally different multimodal fusion strategies that:
- Explicitly model anatomical structure-function relationships
- Incorporate clinical domain knowledge into attention mechanisms  
- Provide traceable reasoning paths from visual features to diagnostic conclusions

### 3. Impact Assessment
If validated, this approach would:
- Reshape how MLLMs are designed for medical applications
- Establish new evaluation standards for medical AI interpretability
- Enable safer clinical deployment through explainable diagnostic pathways

## Research Vector & Risk Analysis

**Biggest Dimension of Risk**: The assumption that explicit region grounding improves both accuracy and interpretability may prove incorrect—potentially sacrificing model performance for explainability without clinical benefit.

**Validation Strategy**: Direct comparison between region-aware architectures and current end-to-end approaches on standardized cancer detection benchmarks, measuring both performance and clinician trust metrics.

## Technical Innovation Areas

1. **Architecture**: Develop region-aware multimodal transformers with explicit anatomical attention
2. **Training**: Design curriculum learning strategies that progress from region identification to diagnostic reasoning
3. **Evaluation**: Create comprehensive benchmarks measuring accuracy, interpretability, and clinical utility

## Expected Contributions

This research will provide:
- Novel architectural paradigms for medical MLLMs
- Empirical validation of region-aware reasoning benefits
- Clinical evaluation frameworks for trustworthy AI systems
- Open-source implementations and benchmarks for the research community
