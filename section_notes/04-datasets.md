# Datasets for Cancer Detection Research

## Research Framework & Hypothesis-Driven Selection

### Core Research Hypothesis
**H1:** Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) can achieve superior cancer detection performance compared to traditional CNN architectures by learning continuous, high-resolution medical image representations.

**H2:** Multi-modal fusion of tabular clinical data with medical imaging through INR embeddings will improve diagnostic accuracy over single-modality approaches.

### Dataset Selection Methodology

Following the research methodology in CLAUDE.md, our dataset collection strategy addresses three critical research dimensions:

1. **Hypothesis Testing**: Datasets directly test INR vs CNN performance assumptions
2. **Generalizability**: Multiple data types ensure robust evaluation across modalities  
3. **Scalability**: Range from development datasets to production-scale benchmarks

    transforms.Grayscale(num_output_channels=1),
    transforms.ToTensor(),
    transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485], std=[0.229])
])

# INR-specific coordinate encoding
def get_coordinate_grid(height, width):
    coords = torch.meshgrid(
        torch.linspace(-1, 1, height),
        torch.linspace(-1, 1, width),
        indexing='ij'
    )
    return torch.stack(coords, dim=-1)
```

### Multi-modal Fusion Pipeline
```python
# Clinical data + imaging fusion for INR
def create_multimodal_input(clinical_features, image_coords):
    # Normalize clinical features
    clinical_normalized = StandardScaler().fit_transform(clinical_features)
    
    # Expand clinical features to image coordinates
    clinical_expanded = clinical_features.unsqueeze(1).unsqueeze(1)
    clinical_tiled = clinical_expanded.repeat(1, height, width, 1)
    
    # Concatenate with spatial coordinates
    multimodal_input = torch.cat([image_coords, clinical_tiled], dim=-1)
